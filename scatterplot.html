  <p style="padding-left : 2%">The scatterplot of "Arable Land % & Rural Population Vs GDP" depicts the average GDP in US $ on the x-axis versus the average percentage of Arable Land along the Y-axis and the rural population as the size of the
    circles in the scatter plot.
    The color scheme is based on the continents namely Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania.</p>

    <h3>So what does it mean?</h3><br />
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">Though urbanization is purported to be the way to increase a country's GDP, the true strength of a nation lies in its farmland and rural population.</p>
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">Countries with good amount of arable land and significant rural population tend to have a higher GDP.</p>
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">Interestingly, countries like Monaco, Morocco and Singapore which are conduits on popular trade routes also have a significant GDP despite their small land area. But they are the exception rather than the norm!</p>
    <p style="padding-left : 2%">Maybe it is time we gave credit where it is due and focussed our sustainability efforts on the rural populace and agriculture.</p>
